#### Projects
- **DIY Surface Micromachining**:  
  *Created a 3D printed machine to create ~100 micron sized features in wax blocks. Made a logic/control board and integrated software for machining passes.*  
  - Designed, printed, as sembled, created circuit for, and fully coded a 2.5 DoF machine capable of consistent movements within 10 microns and costistent feature machining within 100 microns.
  - Got experience with micromachining and resin casting, created a sample of dry adhesive ("gecko tape")

- **Personal Assistive Input Device**:  
  *Created a wearable input device that allows users to control any Bluetooth device with any movement. First-of-its-kind algorithm allows for programmable path detection with only 5-10 samples.*  
  - Designed, programmed, and ported a vector database-driven detection algorithm to low-power microcontroller hardware for fast edge machine learning.
  - Designed and printed a small, non-intrusive and comfortable wearable housing.
