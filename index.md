## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Biomedical Engineering Sophomore at Cornell University. I like to make things and also do code and simulations sometimes. This portfolio is not required for me and I have my own separate portfolio elsewhere. This is for my ENGRD2020: Statics and Mechanics of Solids class.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
